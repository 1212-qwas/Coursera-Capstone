## Introduction
Can we predict a Toronto apartment's rental price by knowing the businesses around it? This capstone is an exploration to see what effect businesses have on nearby apartment prices, and to try and determine the trends that lead to more expensive or desirable living space. If we know that certain businesses impact the price of an apartment when they open nearby, we can locate businesses that are more valuable to people. It can help land developers and business owners better forecast how new businesses can have an impact on rent prices of neighborhoods.
